      I chose the cyclist penguin as my source of student data. Due to the larger
      amounts of data for homework and quiz grades, I decided to make histograms
      for both categories to display the frequency of the various grades ranges
      earned by the "student" in each section. I generated my graphs by
      using google docs to create a spreadsheet that would hold all of the
      needed data. From there, I used the chart functions of goole docs to make
      the two histograms from the data sets I chose. I chose to have two spearate
      histograms due to the separate sections having different max scales. I
      also did not include the exam scores simmply based on the lack of data
      entries.
